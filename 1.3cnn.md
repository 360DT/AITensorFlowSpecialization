## Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks

### 1.3.1 Convolution and pooling

#### Convolution

For every pixel, take its value, and take a look at the value of its neighbors. If our **filter** is 3x3, then we can take a look at the immediate neighbor, so that you have a corresponding 3x3 grid. Then to get the new value for the pixel, we simply multiply each neighbor by the corresponding value in the filter. 

So, for example, in this case, our pixel has the value 192, and its upper left neighbor has the value zero. The upper left value and the filter is negative one, so we multiply zero by negative one. Then we would do the same for the upper neighbor. Its value is 64 and the corresponding filter value was zero, so we'd multiply those out. Repeat this for each neighbor and each corresponding filter value, and would then have the new pixel with the sum of each of the neighbor values multiplied by the corresponding filter value, and that's a **convolution**. 

#### Convolution for emphasizing

The idea here is that some convolutions will change the image in such a way that certain features in the image get emphasized. 

So, for example, if you look at this filter, then the vertical lines in the image really pop out: 
<img src="./img/cnnverticalEmphasize.png"/>

With this filter, the horizontal lines pop out:
<img src="./img/cnnhorizontalEmphasize.png"/>


#### Convolution combined with pooling, they can become really powerful

#### Pooling

Simply, pooling is a way of compressing an image.

Of these four, pick the biggest value and keep just that.

This will preserve the features that were highlighted by the convolution, while simultaneously quartering the size of the image. We have the horizontal and vertical axes.
