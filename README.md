# AITensorFlowSpecialization.

This is my notes for the coursera course [TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice), which talks about building scalable AI-powered algorithms in TensorFlow.

This specialization will include four main contents:
1. Develop an understanding of how to build and train neural networks. 
2. Improve a networkâ€™s performance using convolutions. Train it to identify real-world images.  
3. Teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems.  
4. Process text, represent sentences as vectors, and input data to a neural network. Train an AI to create original poetry.



There are actually four courses:
1. [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow)
2. [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow)
3. [Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow)
4. [Sequences, Time Series and Prediction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction)

## Notes:
1.1 [A new programming paradigm](1.1helloworldNeuralNet.md)

Introduction of difference between ML and traditional programming.

A hello world neural network program using TensorFlow.

1.2 [Introduction to Computer Vision](1.2computervision.md)

Introduction of dataset Fashion MNIST.

Use this dataset to train a neural network to recognize clothes. Classify a picture of one piece of clothes into 10 categorites.

Exercise 2 is handwriting recognition using dataset MNIST.

1.3 [Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks](1.3cnn.md)

Introduce convolution and pooling. And how to implement them in code (add few layers before flattening layer).

Exercise 3 is handwriting recognition using dataset MNIST with CNN.

1.4 [Using Real-world Images](1.4compleximages.md)
