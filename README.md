# AITensorFlowSpecialization.

This is my notes for the coursera course [TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice), which talks about building scalable AI-powered algorithms in TensorFlow.

This specialization will include four main contents:
1. Develop an understanding of how to build and train neural networks. 
2. Improve a networkâ€™s performance using convolutions. Train it to identify real-world images.  
3. Teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems.  
4. Process text, represent sentences as vectors, and input data to a neural network. Train an AI to create original poetry.



There are actually four courses:
1. [Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow)
2. [Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow)
3. [Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/natural-language-processing-tensorflow)
4. [Sequences, Time Series and Prediction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/tensorflow-sequences-time-series-and-prediction)
