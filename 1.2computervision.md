### 1.2.1 Fashion MNIST dataset

[Fashion MNIST dataset:](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)
- 70k images
- 10 categories
- Images are 28X28 in gray scale *
- Can train a neural net

\* Each pixel can be represented in values from zero to 255 and so it's only one byte per pixel. With 28 by 28 pixels in an image, only 784 bytes are needed to store the entire image. 


### 1.2.2 Load dataset

```python
fashion_mnist = keras.datasets.fashion_mnist
(train_images,train_labels),(test_images,test_labels)=fashion_minist.load_data()
```

\* Train/test is 60000/10000.
